It uses a crystal display to show a timer ticking down on what appears to be a bomb.
But when the timer runs out the display reveals that its a prank. Im also using a pie-
zo buzzer to create a ticking sound(see video).

# How it works

By connecting a python script and an arduino script i can customize how long it should
count and what it should display when the timer runs out. Im also using a knob to controll
the brightness of the letters.

# Why i made it

I stumbelled on to the display while i was looking trough my electronic box. I thought
it would be a fun ide to control with the help of my computer. Im also a big fan of
piezo buzzer so i implemented it into the project as well.
